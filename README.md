## WatchedIT

WatchedIT is a simple app where you can find, view and explore films and create a watched list to track the films you have seen. This is inspired by apps such as [Letteboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) .

The purpose of this application is to learn React Native and how it compares to other tech I have used such as Quasar, Ionic, and Cordova. Due to this I have tried to keep all development concentrated on visible elements such as design and user interaction and decided to mock the data with JSON as opposed to creating a real API though I may add this in the future.
